# Customer Churn Prediction

A 'Customer Churn Prediction' is a project where I developed and deployed a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a subscription-based business. Leveraging advanced techniques and algorithms, I achieved accurate predictions (84.5%) to identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

More Info:

• How does it work? The project utilized machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to predict customer churn based on historical data and relevant features.

• Resources: (1.) Python programming language; (2.) Scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries for machine learning modeling; (3.) Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation; (4.) Version control using Git.

• Showcased at (off-site): Guided by Dr. R. Venkatesan (Division of Computer Science and Engineering), Reviewed by Mrs. M. Bhuvaneshwari (Division of Data Science and Cyber Security).
